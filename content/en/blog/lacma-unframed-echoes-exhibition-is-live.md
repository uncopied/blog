As announced on [LACMA UNFRAMED](https://unframed.lacma.org/2022/02/04/introducing-echoes-virtual-exhibition-lacma-art-tech-lab-epoch-gallery-and-uncopied),
ECHOES, a Virtual Exhibition from the LACMA Art + Tech Lab, EPOCH Gallery, and UNCOPIED was [released as a NFT](https://epoch.gallery/echoes-nft/).

{{< figure src="/images/EPOCH_ECHOES.png" title="ECHOES – featuring American Artist | Lukas Avendaño, EYIBRA (Abraham Brody), NNUX (Ana Lopez), and Oswaldo Erreve | Jacqueline Kiyomi Gork and Rhett LaRue | Lawrence Lek | Jen Liu | Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello | Sarah Rara" >}}

["ECHOES," 1/5](https://www.nftexplorer.app/asset/603960750) was already acquired by a collector, and its smart contract was triggered to pay all artists involved in the collective artwork.

The associated [UNCOPIED certificate](https://api.uncopied.art/c/v/w) proves provenance with additional metadata. It also intends to clarify intellectual property and collector's rights with a comprehensive legal document.
